# Scrape PDF data using VBA

This was done as a favour for someone and I used it as an excuse to learn VBA. This VBA macro scrapes some test results from a PDF that they regularly recieved (and the file has a consistent format/layout). The aim was for this to be usable by anyone on a team, so the key requirement was that it only used Excel/VBA and Word since the Microsoft Office software would be installed for everyone. It could not use Adobe Reader or other programming languages.
