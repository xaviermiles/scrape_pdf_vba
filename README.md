# Scrape PDF data using VBA

This was done as a favour for someone and I used it as an excuse to learn VBA. This VBA macro scrapes some test results from a PDF that they regularly recieved (and the file has a consistent format/layout). The aim was for this to be usable by anyone on a team, so the key requirement was that it only used Excel/VBA and Word since the Microsoft Office software would be installed for everyone (the reference "Microsoft Word 16.0 Object Library" must be enabled in Excel). It could not use Adobe Reader or other programming languages.

The original PDF was editted to remove sensitive information. The scraper doesn't completely work for the example PDF, but I can't figure out what is wrong with the PDF.
